JsonStreaming.NET is a solution that provides a set of libraries (`Ndjson.AsyncStreams.*`) for working with asynchronous streaming data sources over HTTP using JSONL (JSON Lines) and NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON).

## Donating

My blog and open source projects are result of my passion for software development, but they require a fair amount of my personal time. If you got value from any of the content I create, then I would appreciate your support by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/tpeczek) (either monthly or one-time).
